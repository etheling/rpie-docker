# rpie-docker

For testing/experimentation. Only. Dockerfiles for building / running retropie/retroarch under KMS/DRM, X, Wayland on x64. Host OS must have working X, Wayland or KMS/DRM running. Not tested on arm. 

NOTE: when something doesn't work, you never know if it's a retro*/OS config problem, or Docker problem. This is to say that running Retro* from container is propably not a good idea.
